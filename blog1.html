					<h2>Answering the Russia Question</h2>

					<h3>April 11, 2018</h3>

				</header>

				<article>
					<p>In a previous article entitled American Abdication, I began discussing the United State’s retreat from global leadership by contrasting it with the previous successes of the US Marshall Plan. The goal of this plan was to spread democracy, mutual trust, and trade between countries in Europe, especially Germany, who held most of Europe’s industrial capabilities even after World War II had ended. Just as much however, it was a necessary counter to Soviet aggression in the region. Had the United States not fully engaged with Western Europe after World War II, it would have been left to the Soviet Union to rebuild the continent in their image. This would have meant a European continent fully subservient to Communist forces in Moscow, and it surely would have provided the USSR with the strength not only to prevent its future dissolution, but also to challenge the USA directly. As such, investment in Western Europe after World War II was seen not so much as a humanitarian effort, but as a matter of national security, and without it, the Cold War would surely have turned hot.</p>

					<p>Today, the Western world is inundated with a barrage of stories concerning the atrocities of the Russian government, its proxies, and its (very few) allies. Unfortunately, the Western world has been slow to realize the cause of these provocations, and it has hampered our ability to effectively deal with them. The reason we have been unable to grasp Russian intent is due in part to the way we learn history:</p>

			

					<p>Growing up, our history lessons are put into an arbitrary vacuum that limits our ability to fully grasp the cause and effect relationships that define the global course of events. For example, can you explain the direct cause and effect relationship between World War II and the Cold War? Most cannot. In fact, most are unaware that such a relationship exists, and most people think the two conflicts are unrelated when they are actually attached at the hip. This is because, in school, we are taught about WWII, and we are taught about the Cold War, but we are not taught that the diplomatic standoff that ensued after World War II as the United States and Russia competed over the future of Europe, leading directly to the Cold War. We are taught about NATO, but we are not taught that NATO, a mutual defense agreement between the US and Western Europe, only came about out of sheer necessity when the Soviet Union used military force to install a Communist government in Czechoslovakia during the Marshall Plan years- this will be revisited soon.</p>

					<p>So, because our understanding of history is so often limited to “in this year, this happened”, instead of examining why things happened, we look at the actions 	of the Russian government and can find no logical explanation for it, even though one stares us in the face. So to begin, if we want to understand why the Russian government acts how it acts, we must first understand what motivates it.</p>

					<h3>Geography</h3>

					<p>Russia’s western border is a vast plain, with no mountain ranges or bodies of water obstructing a potential enemy from invading it. In fact, from the years 1812 to 1941, Russia was invaded four separate times, leading to a deep feeling of insecurity amongst the Soviet government and its people. So, when Western Europe was ravaged by the effects of World War II, Russia sought to use this moment of comparative advantage to secure its borders by installing pro-Russian governments in its neighboring states.</p>

				
					<p>In this picture we can see how, in the wake of World War II, the Soviet government extended their influence as far west as East Germany. The expansion of Soviet influence into Germany was significant for three reasons: the first being that Eastern Germany housed much of Germany’s remaining industrial capacity, providing the Soviet Union with a means to rebuild their own country in the short term, and export goods in the long term. The second reason this was significant is that it further expanded the Soviet “Buffer zone”, which served to protect the Soviet heartland. The final, and most important reason this was significant, is because Germany had just invaded Russia in the World War II, so keeping Germany divided into two states, with the more powerful state (including the German capital of Berlin) being held under Soviet control, ensured that the heartland of Russia would never again be invaded.</p>

					<p>As such, the Soviet government did everything in its power to ensure that the spread of democracy stopped at West Germany, this includes the aforementioned military coup in The Czech Republic, designed to prevent a democratic government not loyal to Moscow from taking form in the Soviet sphere of influence. Prior to this coup, the United States was immensely reluctant to pledge any military support to Europe on top of its sizeable economic support. However, the Soviet coup of The Czech Republic made it clear to Western leaders that if the United States did not guarantee military support to western European countries, then Russia would continue engaging in such activities whenever they felt threatened. As a result, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed shortly after the end of WWII. This treaty was originally meant to keep the Soviets from attempting to expand their influence past East Germany, but after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, a large power vacuum from East Germany to the western border of Russia was formed, and NATO began to fill that vacuum.</p>

					<h3>The Problem with NATO Expansion</h3>

					<p>As we have just discussed, The Soviet Union, and now Russia, seek to make up for the lack of geographic barriers to invasion by creating buffer states. When the Soviet Union fell, and NATO began expanding to the east, devouring Russia’s former buffer states, a feeling of deep insecurity once again took hold in Russia. This happened at a critical time in Russia’s history because after the USSR had fallen and before Vladimir Putin came to power, there was a large appetite amongst the Russian people to democratize (years 1992-1999). However, pro-democracy advocates in Russia were vying for closer ties with the West at the same time the West was putting military bases closer and closer to the borders of Russia. This had the effect of undermining the credibility of the Russian democrats, while those in favor of a nationalist, authoritarian government exploited the fears of their people by contending that Russia must do everything in its power to counter the West’s NATO expansion, or risk being invaded again.</p>

					<p>Today, we are experiencing the adverse effects of the irresponsible expansion of NATO. Not only did this expansion give Vladimir Putin the little political cover he needed to kill Russian democracy in its infancy, but it also played directly into his hand by allowing him to portray the West as an enemy of Russia, regardless of whether or not that is/was actually true.</p>
